## Building

To build NServiceBus just open `NServiceBus.sln` in Visual Studio.

You'll find the built assemblies in /binaries.

If you see the build failing, check that you haven't put the source of NServiceBus in a deep subdirectory since long path names (greater than 248 characters) aren't supported by MSBuild.
