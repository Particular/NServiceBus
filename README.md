## Building

To build NServiceBus from source files you can either:
* Build using VS2012, open `NServiceBus.sln`
* Or build using Powershell by executing `build.bat`

You'll find the built assemblies in /binaries.

If you see the build failing, check that you haven't put the source of NServiceBus in a deep subdirectory since long path names (greater than 248 characters) aren't supported by MSBuild.

## Running

To run NServiceBus, please download and install the setup file from http://www.nservicebus.com/Downloads.aspx

Feel free to use this code any way you want to. As a favor to me, you can leave the copyright in there. You never know when someone might recognize your name! 

If you do use the code in a commercial product, I would appreciate hearing about it. This message serves as legal notice that I won't be suing you for royalties!  The code is in the public domain.

On the other hand, I don't provide support. The code is actually simple enough that it shouldn't need it.
