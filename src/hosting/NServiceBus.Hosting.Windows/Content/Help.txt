NServiceBus Message Endpoint Host Service

USAGE:
	NServiceBus.Host.exe [/install [/serviceName]
                           [/displayName]
                           [/description]
                           [/endpointConfigurationType]
                           [/endpointName]
                           [/installInfrastructure]
                           [/scannedAssemblies]
                           [/dependsOn]
                           [/sideBySide]
                           [/startManually]
                           [/username]
                           [/password]] |
                          [/uninstall [/serviceName]
                           [/sidebyside]]
										
OPTIONS:

/install                    Install the message endpoint as a Windows service.
/serviceName                Specify the service name for the installed service.
/displayName                Friendly name for the installed service.
/description                Description for the service.
/endpointConfigurationType	Specify the type implementing IConfigureThisEndpoint 
                            that should be used.
/dependsOn                  Specifies the names of services or groups which must 
                            start before this service. The names are separated by 
                            colons (,).
/sideBySide                 Install the service with the version included in the 
                            service name. This allows running multiple endpoints 
                            side by side when doing hot deployments.
/endpointName               The name of this endpoint.
/installInfrastructure      Runs the infrastructure installers, this will install 
                            things like MSMQ, RavenDB if needed.
/scannedAssemblies          Configures NServiceBus to use the types found in the 
                            given assemblies. The names are separated by 
                            semicolons (;).
/startManually              Specifies that the service should start manually.
/username                   Username for the account the service should run under.
/password                   Password for the service account.

If no service name is specified NServiceBus will use the full name of the 
endpoint configuration type (that which implements NServiceBus.IConfigureThisEndpoint)
along with the version number of the assembly it is contained within, for example:

	MyPublisher.Endpoint_v1.0.0.0
	
The default for the display name is the same value as the service name, and the description
defaults to a generic NServiceBus host description.

You can also specify the endpoint configuration type in the file NServiceBus.Host.exe.config.
This file is optional.

If you don't specify the endpoint configuration type either in the command-line or in the
NServiceBus.Host.exe.config file, all the DLLs in the runtime directory will be scanned
for a type that implements NServiceBus.IConfigureThisEndpoint.

If you set the service name and sidebyside during installation you will need to specify
them when uninstalling them as well, ex:

	NServiceBus.Host.exe /uninstall /serviceName:"MyPublisher" /sidebyside
	
EXAMPLES:
	NServiceBus.Host.exe /install /serviceName:"MyPublisher" /displayName:"My Publisher Service"
		/description:"Service for publishing event messages" 
		/endpointConfigurationType:"YourEndpointConfigType.YourNameSpace, YourAssembly"
		/username:"corp\serviceuser"
		/password:"p@ssw0rd!" NServiceBus.Production
