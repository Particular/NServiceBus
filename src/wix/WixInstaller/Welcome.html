    <h2>NServiceBus</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to NServiceBus. This package contains set of tools, code samples and documentation
        designed to help you develop and build NServiceBus applications.</p>
    <p>
        For access to additional resources and information, such as downloads, forum posts,
        and extra documentation, go to the <a href="http://particular.net">Particular
            website.</a></p>
    <h3>
        The NServiceBus package contains the following items:</h3>

    <h4>Tools description:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Tools/migration/">TimeoutMigrator.exe</a></div>
            This tool will extract your version 2.6 Timeouts and send them over to the new 3.0
            TM that will be responsible for managing them. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Tools/">ReturnToSourceQueue.exe</a></div>
            This tool sends messages from the error queue back to its original queue so that
            they can be processed again. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Tools/">XsdGenerator.exe</a></div>
            Allows you to take your message schema classes and generate an XSD that will allow
            developers on other platforms to use to send messages with (though those messages
            would likely be coming in over HTTP via the gateway). </li>
        <li>
             <div>
                 <a href="./Tools/licenseinstaller/">LicenseInstaller.exe</a></div>

    <h4>Samples description:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/AsyncPages/">AsyncPages</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the use of NServiceBus in a web application. What you'll
            see is how to configure NServiceBus for use in a web application, how to use the
            bus to send a message, and how to handle the response. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/AsyncPagesMVC3/">AsyncPages MVC3</a></div>
            Similar to <a href="./Samples/AsyncPages/">AsyncPages</a>, this sample illustrates
            the use of NServiceBus in a ASP.NET MVC 3 web application. What you'll see is how
            to configure NServiceBus for use in a web application, how to use the bus to send
            a message, both in synchronous and asynchronous mode. and how to handle the response.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/Encryption/">Encryption</a></div>
            This sample illustrates how to encrypt data transmitted in messages by NServiceBus.
            What you'll see is how to define messages containing sensitive data, how to specify
            that the bus use an encryption service, and how to configure the keys that encryption
            service uses. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/FullDuplex/">Full Duplex - Request/Response</a></div>
            This sample illustrates how to full duplex - request/response communication works
            with NServiceBus. What you'll see is how to define messages, how to specify the
            destination for a message, and how to handle messages when they are received.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/GenericHost/">Generic Host - Logging</a></div>
            This sample illustrates the various ways to use the NServiceBus host process to
            configure logging. You'll see the minimal amount of configuration necessary to set
            up logging, how to go back to standard log4net configuration, and the extensibility
            model using profiles. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/PubSub/">PubSub</a></div>
            This sample shows publish subscribe messaging using NServiceBus. This sample is
            also the "Getting Started" section of the documentation and shows polymorphic subscriptions
            as well as durable subscriptions for publisher fault-tolerance. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/Versioning/">Versioning</a></div>
            This sample is based on the PubSub sample above and shows how to go about versioning
            messages in this environment. You'll see how to inherit message types, how subscribers
            can continue to receive messages in the old schema even when the publisher publishes
            messages in the new schema. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/MessageMutators/">Message Mutators</a></div>
            Beginning NServiceBus V3, there are 2 types of message mutators, one that operates
            on the applicative messages and another one that operates on the physical transport
            messages. Reacting to individual messages can be used to perform things like validation
            of outgoing/incoming messages. Transport message works on the entire transport message
            are useful for things like compression, header manipulation etc. Find all about
            it in the sample or the the documentation about it. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/Unobtrusive/">Unobtrusive Mode</a></div>
            Unobtrusive mode messages allows you to pass in your own conventions to determine
            which types are message definitions instead of using the IMessage interface. Other
            than the sample, you can read more about it here. </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/DataBus/">Data Bus</a></div>
            Large chunks of data, such as images or video files can be transported using NServiceBus
            V3 data bus. The only thing you have to do is put an attribute over your large property
            and NServiceBus will take care of the rest. See how it works in the sample.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <a href="./Samples/ScaleOut/">Scale out</a></div>
            Similar in behavior to standard load balancers the NServiceBus Distributor is the
            key to scaling out message processing over many machines transparently. You can
            read more about it here, or see it in action in the sample. </li>
