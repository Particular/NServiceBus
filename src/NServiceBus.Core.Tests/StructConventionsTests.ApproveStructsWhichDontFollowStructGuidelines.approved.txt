-------------------------------------------------- REMEMBER --------------------------------------------------
CONSIDER defining a struct instead of a class if instances of the type are small and commonly short-lived or are commonly embedded in other objects.

AVOID defining a struct unless the type has all of the following characteristics:
   * It logically represents a single value, similar to primitive types(int, double, etc.).
   * It has an instance size under 16 bytes.
   * It is immutable.
   * It will not have to be boxed frequently.

In all other cases, you should define your types as classes.

NServiceBus.LogicalAddress violates the following rules:
   - The following fields are reference types, which are potentially mutable:
      - Field <EndpointInstance>k__BackingField of type NServiceBus.Routing.EndpointInstance is a reference type.

NServiceBus.MessageQueueExtensions+ACE_HEADER violates the following rules:
   - The following fields are public, so the type is not immutable:
      - Field AceType of type System.Byte is public.
      - Field AceFlags of type System.Byte is public.
      - Field AceSize of type System.Int16 is public.

NServiceBus.MessageQueueExtensions+ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE violates the following rules:
   - The following fields are public, so the type is not immutable:
      - Field Header of type NServiceBus.MessageQueueExtensions+ACE_HEADER is public.
      - Field Mask of type System.UInt32 is public.
      - Field SidStart of type System.Int32 is public.

NServiceBus.MessageQueueExtensions+ACL_SIZE_INFORMATION violates the following rules:
   - The following fields are public, so the type is not immutable:
      - Field AceCount of type System.UInt32 is public.
      - Field AclBytesInUse of type System.UInt32 is public.
      - Field AclBytesFree of type System.UInt32 is public.

NServiceBus.Features.SLAMonitoring+EstimatedTimeToSLABreachCounter+DataPoint violates the following rules:
   - The size is 24 bytes, which exceeds the recommended maximum of 16 bytes.
