-------------------------------------------------- REMEMBER --------------------------------------------------
CONSIDER defining a struct instead of a class if instances of the type are small and commonly short-lived or are commonly embedded in other objects.

AVOID defining a struct unless the type has all of the following characteristics:
   * It logically represents a single value, similar to primitive types(int, double, etc.).
   * It has an instance size under 16 bytes.
   * It is immutable.
   * It will not have to be boxed frequently.

In all other cases, you should define your types as classes.

NServiceBus.LogicalAddress violates the following rules:
   - The following fields are reference types, which are potentially mutable:
      - Field <EndpointInstance>k__BackingField of type NServiceBus.Routing.EndpointInstance is a reference type.
   - The size cannot be determined because there are fields that are reference types.
