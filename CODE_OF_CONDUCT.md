# Code of conduct for the Particular GitHub community

This code of conduct applies to all contributors, commenters, and participants in Particular Software's GitHub repositories.

These repositories exist to support focused, professional, and technical collaboration around Particular's platform-including contributions to documentation, samples, source code, issue discussions, and community guidance.

We expect all community members to uphold the standards below, in line with the broader [Code of conduct for the Particular community](https://github.com/Particular/DeveloperEducation/blob/master/policies/community-code-of-conduct.md).

## Our values in action

We believe the best outcomes come from open, respectful collaboration. Whether you're opening a pull request, reporting a bug, or reviewing a proposed change, you're helping make Particular better-and how we work together matters.

We ask everyone to:

- Use clear, professional, and respectful language  
- Stay focused on the technical subject at hand  
- Welcome questions and encourage learning  
- Assume good intent, and be open to feedback  
- Respond constructively to ideas, not people  
- Avoid sarcasm, gatekeeping, or dismissiveness

## Unacceptable behavior

We do not tolerate:

- Harassment, bullying, or personal attacks  
- Dismissive or sarcastic responses to genuine contributions  
- Discrimination of any kind  
- Trolling, baiting, or inflammatory comments  
- Posting of explicit, offensive, or irrelevant content

Keep in mind that even brief comments can have lasting impact. If you're unsure whether something might be offensive, leave it out, or ask first.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all activity on Particular-owned GitHub repositories, including:

- Issues and pull requests  
- Discussions and comments  
- Commit messages  
- Code reviews  
- Community documentation contributions  

It also applies when representing the Particular community in GitHub-sponsored spaces (e.g., GitHub Discussions or GitHub-hosted community events).

## Reporting a concern

To report a potential violation, email:  
**concerns@particular.net**

Reports are reviewed confidentially and assessed on a case-by-case basis. If you don't feel comfortable reporting directly, you may ask a trusted community member to do so on your behalf.

## Enforcement and consequences

Community moderators and repository maintainers may take action to address behavior that violates this code of conduct.

Possible actions include:

- A private warning or request for correction  
- Editing or removal of inappropriate content  
- Temporary or permanent restriction from commenting or contributing  
- Escalation to GitHub or legal authorities, where appropriate

In all cases, our goal is to protect the health, safety, and productivity of the community.

## Final note

By participating in Particular's GitHub repositories, you agree to follow this code of conduct and contribute to a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive community.

Thank you for helping make the Particular ecosystem better for everyone.
