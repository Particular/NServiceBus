= NServiceBus License =
=======================

By accessing NServiceBus code here, you are agreeing to the following licensing terms.
If you do not agree to these terms, do not access the NServiceBus code.

Your license to the NServiceBus source and/or binaries is governed by the Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL1.5) license as described here: 

http://www.opensource.org/licenses/rpl1.5.txt

If you do not wish to release the source of software you build using NServiceBus, you may use NServiceBus source and/or binaries under the NServiceBus Express End User License Agreement as described here:

http://www.nservicebus.com/EULA.aspx


============
= Building =
============

The following web page contains information about how to build NServiceBus form source files:
http://nservicebus.com/BuildingNServiceBusFromSource.aspxIn order to build the source, run the build.ps1 powershell script.

You'll find the built assemblies in /build/binaries.

If you see CS1668 warning when building under 2008, go to the 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A' directory and create the 'lib' subdirectory.

If you see the build failing, check that you haven't put nServiceBus in a deep subdirectory since long path names (greater than 248 characters) aren't supported by MSBuild.


===========
= Running =
===========

To run NServiceBus Msmq and MSDTC need to be installed and configured on your machine. To do this please
run RunMeFirst.bat.

Running an nServiceBus process is simple. Any external dependencies that are needed like MSMQ, MSDTC, databases will be set up automatically at startup if they aren't found.


=========
= Sagas =
=========

The 'Manufacturing' sample shows the use of sagas.

Feel free to use this code any way you want to. As a favor to me, you can leave the copyright in there. You never know when someone might recognize your name! 

If you do use the code in a commercial product, I would appreciate hearing about it. This message serves as legal notice that I won't be suing you for royalties!  The code is in the public domain.

On the other hand, I don't provide support. The code is actually simple enough that it shouldn't need it.
